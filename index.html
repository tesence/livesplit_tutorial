                            This tutorial aims to explain how to fully setup LiveSplit and more specifically for
                            <i>Ori and the Blind Forest Definitive Edition</i>. It follows the
                            <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/ori_de/guide/0hzv7">video tutorial</a> originally made

                            LiveSplit is a timer program for speedrunners made to help you time your runs and track
                            your progress by allowing you to split your run into individual segments. Some games may
                            have tools called "autosplitters" that will automatically split for you, which is the case
                            for Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition. Finally it embeds SpeedRunsLive support to
                            allow you to join races and compete with the community members.

                            All you need is to download LiveSplit
                            <a href="https://livesplit.github.io/downloads/">here</a> and to go through the
                            installation. Once the installation is done, launch LiveSplit and you will get something
                            like this:

                        <h2 id="autosplitter">Autosplitter</h2>
                        <p>
                            The autosplitter is a LiveSplit tool which splits when a condition based on a game event is
                            filled. The latest versions of LiveSplit embed an autosplitter for Ori and the Blind Forest
                            created by DevilSquirrel.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Enable the autosplitter</h3>
                        <p>
                            To enable the autosplitter, you first need to set the game and the category you're
                            running and LiveSplit will detect if there is an autosplitter available for it. Here we
                            want to set
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> Game Name: Ori and the Blind Forest Definitive Edition</li>
                            <li> Run Category: All Skills</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            To do so, go to <i>"Edit Splits..."</i>
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="resources/livesplit-game-name.png">

                            <figure>

                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            If you're running a subcategory (No OOB/TA is a sub category of All Skills alongside No
                            Restrictions), you may also need to set it in the <i>"Additional Info"</i> tab. Here you
                            want to set the All Skills sub category <i>"No OOB/TA"</i>.
                        </p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="resources/livesplit-subcategory.png">

                        <p>
                            Now you should see that a configurable autosplitter is available for this game. You should
                            now be able to <i>"Activate"</i> it.
                        </p>

                        <figure>

                            <figcaption>Activate autosplitter</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <br/>

                        <h3>Configure the autosplitter</h3>
                        <p>
                            In order to configure the autosplitter, click the <i>"Settings"</i> button next to the
                            <i>"Activate"</i> one. You should have something like this:
                        </p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="resources/default-autosplitter-settings.png">

                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            For now there are only 2 autosplits set, <i>"Start Game"</i> and <i>"End Game"</i> which
                            will respectively start the timer when you chose the difficulty and stop it when you lose
                            the control of Naru at the end of the run.
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <figure>
                                <img class="gif" src="resources/prologue-skip.gif">

                        </div>
                        <br/>

                        <p>
                            You are basically good to go. Nevertheless you might want to add some splits in the
                            middle of the run to track your progress, see where you lose time from one run to
                            another and compute what we call a Sum of Bests.
                        </p>


                        <h2 id="splits&layout">Splits & Layout</h2>
                        <p>
                            Until now, you had a unique split. The split will be used to record the timer value when you
                            finishes the run. This is your <b>end game split</b>. Before doing anything, we will give
                            that split a name. It can be whatever you want, but we will name it "End" to keep it
                            explicit.
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <img src="resources/split-end-game.png">
                            <img src="resources/layout-end-game.png">
                        </div>
                        <br/>

                        <p>
                            We can now add as many splits as we want, one by one. As an example we will add the "Wall
                            Jump" split to our layout. To do so we first need to to hit <i>"Insert Above"</i> then give
                            the new split the name "Wall Jump".
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <img src="resources/split-wall-jump.png">
                            <img src="resources/layout-wall-jump.png">
                        </div>
                        <br/>

                        <p>
                            We also need to add it to our autosplitter settings to make it split when we actually get
                            wall jump. For that we need to hit <i>"Settings"</i>, and add the correct autosplit
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <img src="resources/autosplit-wall-jump.png">
                            <img src="resources/autosplit-wall-jump-2.png">
                        </div>
                        <br/>

                        <p>
                            That way, we can now add a split for Dash, for Double Jump, for Bash, ...
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b> Everytime you add a new split, you need to make sure that you add its related autosplit
                            and keep everything in the right order. To check that your autosplitter is correctly set up,
                            if you don't count "Start Game" which only starts the timer and does not match any split,
                            you need to have as many autosplits as splits on your layout ! </b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For reference, here is the most common split list for <i>All Skills No OOB/TA</i>
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <img src="resources/default-splits.png">
                            <img src="resources/default-autosplits.png">
                        </div>
                        <br/>

                        <p>
                            Because the layout and the splits are independent, there are extra empty lines. To remove
                            the unwanted lines, go to
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <i>Edit layout... > Layout Settings > Splits</i>
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <img src="resources/default-livesplit-layout-settings.png">
                        </div>
                        <br/>

                        <p>
                            Then decrement the <i>Total Splits</i> value until the layout looks fine. You will need
                            to update this value everytime you add/remove a split.
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <img src="resources/default-livesplit-splits-2.png">
                        </div>
                        <br/>

                        <p>
                            LiveSplit offers a lot of customization tools. Just spend some time in the layout
                            settings and build a LiveSplit layout you like. <br/>
                            Here are examples of what layout you can make with LiveSplit:
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <figure>
                                <img class="livesplit" src="resources/livesplit-grifs.png">
                                <figcaption>Grifs</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <figure>
                                <img class="livesplit" src="resources/livesplit-hydra.png">
                                <figcaption>Hydra</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <figure>
                                <img class="livesplit" src="resources/livesplit-smashy.png">

                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Now that we changed what we needed to, let's save our changes.
                            Right-click on the LiveSplit window, then both click <i>Save Splits</i> and <i>Save
                            Layout</i>. LiveSplit will ask you to save 2 files:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> A LiveSplit Split file (.lss)</li>
                            <li> A LiveSplit Layout file (.lsl)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            I highly recommend you to think about how you will organize your files already. You will
                            probably need a split file and a layout file for each game, and each category of a game. For
                            example, you can create a folder <i>"OriDE"</i> with another <i>"All Skills No OOBTA"</i>
                            inside it, containing both LiveSplit files.
