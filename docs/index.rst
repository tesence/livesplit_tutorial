LiveSplit is a timer program for speedrunners made to help you time your runs
and track your progress by allowing you to split your run into individual
segments. Some games may have tools called "autosplitters" that will
automatically split for you, which is the case for Ori and the Blind Forest:
Definitive Edition. Finally it embeds SpeedRunsLive support to allow you to join
races and compete with the community members.
